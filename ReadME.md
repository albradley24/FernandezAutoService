# FernandezAutoService

This website was completed for a class project. Note that this was a group project and I only worked on pieces of it.

--Miguel Fernandez owns an Auto Shop and he wanted a website to help improve business.
--The website has the company history, pictures of the shop, hours of operation, and a Google map.
--The website also contains a form which users can use to submit feedback about their experience with the shop (not fully functional).
